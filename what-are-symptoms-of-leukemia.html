                                            case of leukemia.

                                    <p><strong>Early Symptoms of Leukemia</strong><br /><br />The first signs of
                                        leukemia are usually non specific and vague.<br /><br />The early signs of
                                        leukemia differ in each person, though most of them experience common flu-like
                                        symptoms. These include fever, chills, weakness, fatigue, and frequent and
                                        recurring infections. The patients exhibit swollen lymph nodes, liver and spleen
                                        along with little red spots under the skin. It also involve loss of appetite,
                                        weight loss and bleeding gums. Bone and joint pains are also noticed and there
                                        is excess bleeding than in a normal cut or bruise.<br /><br />There is a loss of
                                        red blood cells resulting in anemia. Excessive sweating is also seen as an early
                                        sign of leukemia and calls for a diagnosis.<br /><br /><strong>Childhood
                                            Leukemia Symptoms</strong><br /><br />Children affected with leukemia are
                                        more susceptible to infection. One of the early signs of leukemia in children is
                                        the non-functioning of antibiotics for other normal childhood illnesses as
                                        leukemia is immune to antibiotics.<br /><br />Bruises, scratches or cuts are
                                        noticed even for an ordinary cause that wouldn&rsquo;t be that serious enough
                                        ordinarily. In case of bleeding, the blood doesn&rsquo;t stop
                                        quickly.<br /><br />The child experiences pain in bones and joints when the
                                        leukemia cells deposit themselves under the surface of the bone and inside
                                        joints.<br /><br />Another early symptom of leukemia in children is the loss of
                                        appetite and weight-reduction for no known cause.<br /><br />Other commonly
                                        noticed symptoms in children include vomiting, headaches and uncontrolled fits
                                        along with skin reactions. In some cases, there is an enlargement in the
                                        abdominal area as leukemia causes distention in spleen and liver (these are
                                        located in the abdominal area).<br /><br /><br /><strong>Leukemia Symptoms in
                                            Adults<br /></strong><br />Signs of leukemia in adults are more or less
                                        similar to those noticed in children. These include the same flu-like
                                        indications of frequent infection, fever, cold and chills.<br /><br />Fatigue,
                                        weakness, malaise, headaches, seizures, weakness, blurred vision, balancing
                                        inability and vomiting are some common signs of leukemia in adults when it
                                        spreads to the brain.<br /><br />Pain in bones and joints is more severe than in
                                        children. There is a loss of appetite, weight loss and abdominal pain due to
                                        expansion of spleen and liver. The lymph nodes turn tender and swollen. Bruises
                                        and cuts are also noticed at the first provocation.<br /><br />Some of the
                                        exhibited signs of leukemia in men and women alike is shortness of breath,
                                        frequent and lengthy coughing along with suffocation.<br /><br />The symptoms of
                                        leukemia are seen in places where these cells accumulate or are deposited and
                                        the characteristic of the symptoms will be dependent on this. Leukemia can be
                                        chronic or acute type and can be easily diagnosed with regular blood
                                        test.<br /><br />Leukemia is usually caused by radiation exposure or due to
                                        chain smoking or exposure to too much of smoke.<br /><br />Acute symptoms of
                                        leukemia are headaches, vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, or
                                        seizures. They also affect other parts of the body like digestive tract,
                                        kidneys, lungs, heart or testes and the symptoms of the leukemia will be
                                        dependent on which of these regions are
                                        affected.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Common Symptoms of Chronic Leukemia or Acute
                                            Leukemia</strong><br /><br /></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Swollen lymph nodes (especially in the neck or armpit) that can be painful.
                                            Lymph nodes are the regions where blood cleanses itself and can drain the
                                            excess leukemic cells in these regions. This will result in swelling and
                                            inflammation and makes these lymph nodes prone to infections and lymphitis.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Fevers or night sweats</li>
                                        <li>Frequent infections &ndash; this is because the number of increased white
                                            blood cells are immature and do not have the ability to fight bacterial and
                                            viral infections efficiently as under normal conditions. The accumulation of
                                            these immature white blood cells in the bone marrow will also result in
                                            reduction of bone marrow cells required for the synthesis of blood
                                            platelets. Hence, there will be excessive bleeding or development of
                                            pinprick bleeding (petechiae) due to a disturbance in the blood clotting
                                            process resulting in malformed blood clots, and thus one can frequently see
                                            purple patches of blood clots.</li>
                                        <li>Feeling weak or tired</li>
                                        <li>Bleeding and bruising easily (bleeding gums, purplish patches in the skin,
                                            or tiny red spots under the skin</li>
                                        <li>Swelling or discomfort in the abdomen causing pain that may result in loss
                                            of appetite and weight</li>
                                        <li>Weight loss for no reason</li>
                                        <li>Pain in the bones and joints because of cell proliferation in the bone
                                            marrow</li>
                                        <li>Unexplained fevers</li>
                                        <li>Blurred vision</li>
                                        <li>Balance problems</li>
                                        <li>Shortness of breath or dyspnea when the cells accumulate in the chest
                                            resulting in pain and difficulty in breathing seeking immediate medical
                                            attention</li>
                                        <li>Loss of muscle control and seizures</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><br />Anemia &ndash; there will be reduction in the number of red blood cells and
                                        platelets and hence will there be a reduction in the possibility of ability to
                                        carry oxygen leading to a number of other related symptoms.<br /><br />However,
                                        common are these symptoms for other infections also and so only, a doctor can
                                        tell for sure what is what.&nbsp; The good thing about leukemia is that a simple
                                        blood test could be able to help you to diagnose and respond
                                        appropriately.<br /><br />The difference between acute and chronic leukemia is
                                        that in chronic leukemia the symptoms do not appear until the disease is
                                        diagnosed until the later stages after development of cancer in the blood while
                                        in acute leukemia the symptoms are diagnosed immediately and easily.</p>
